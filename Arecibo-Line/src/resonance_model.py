"""Core routines for preparing data and exploring resonances along the line.

This module exposes a light-weight interface that wraps around machine learning
pipelines. While the exact model architecture is left to the practitioner, the
helpers defined here focus on deterministic preprocessing and interpretation so
that the numerological symbolism remains front-and-centre.
